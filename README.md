# WebGL Solar System Model
Written in Javascript using the WebGL API and the glMatrix math library. Custom shaders are used to implement a modified phong illumination model.

## Demo
This demo requires WebGL. Support for WebGL is present in Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 9+, Opera 12+, Safari 5.1+ and Internet Explorer 11+; however, your device must also have hardware that supports these features.

## Plagiarism
I've heard some schools are giving assignments that are quite similar to this project. It was written as a personal project (without connection to any school), then released as open source software.

### Teachers
Unfortunately, I can't hide it from your students. Removing something from the commons for the benefit of an educational institution would be counterproductive to say the least.

### Students
You might be able to use this as reference, but make sure you clearly cite your sources. Remember that your teachers aren't stupid. This code is quite distinctive - even in the abstract. And the person marking your work has probably seen it before.

It took humanity over 2000 years to develop the mathematics behind skeletal animation. Don't feel bad if you don't get it - this stuff is hard. Please seek out your teacher or TAs for help if you need it.
